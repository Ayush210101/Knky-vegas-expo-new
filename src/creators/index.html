              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  To reflect changes in laws and regulatory requirements which
                  apply to KNKY and the services, features, and programs of KNKY
                  where such changes require KNKY to change its terms and

                <li>
                  You confirm that you own all intellectual property rights
                  (examples of which are copyright and trademarks) in your
                  Content or that you have obtained all necessary rights to your
                  Content which are to grant licences in respect of your Content
                  to us and to other Users. This includes any rights to engage
                  in the acts covered by subsection 10(b) below in any territory
                  in which KNKY is accessible and, in particular, in the United
                  States of America, the United Kingdom, and the European Union.
                  You assert that you either own or have obtained necessary
                  licences for all intellectual property in your Content.
                </li>
                <li>
                  You agree to grant us a licence under all your Content to
                  perform any act restricted by any intellectual property right
                  (including copyright) in such Content, for any purpose
                  reasonably related to the provision and operation of KNKY.
                  Such acts include reproducing, making available and
                  communicating to the public, displaying, performing,
                  distributing, translating, and creating adaptations or
                  derivative works of your Content, and otherwise dealing in
                  your Content.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The licence which you grant to us under sub-section 10(B)
                  above is perpetual, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free,
                  sublicensable, assignable, and transferable by us. This means
                  that the licence will continue even after your agreement with
                  us ends and you stop using KNKY, that we do not have to pay
                  you for the licence, and that we can grant a sublicense of
                  your Content to someone else or assign or transfer the licence
                  to someone else. This licence will allow us, for example, to
                  add stickers, text, and watermarks to your Content, to make
                  your Content available to other Users of KNKY, as well as to
                  use your Content for other normal operations of KNKY. We will
                  never sell your Content to other platforms, though we may sell
                  or transfer any licence you grant to us in the Terms of
                  Service in the event of a sale of our company or its assets to
                  a third party.

                <li>
                  Whilst we do not own your Content, you grant us the limited
                  right to submit notifications of infringement (including of
                  copyright or trademark) on your behalf to any third-party
                  website or service that hosts or is otherwise dealing in
                  infringing copies of your Content without your permission.
                  Although we are not under any obligation to do so, we may at
                  any time submit or withdraw any such notification to any
                  third-party website or service where we consider it
                  appropriate to do so. However, we do not and are under no
                  obligation to police infringements of your Content. You agree
                  that if we request, you will provide us with all consents and
                  other information which we reasonably need to submit
                  notifications of infringement on your behalf. Please see our
                  Complaints Policy for how to make a complaint about

                  applicable law to object to derogatory treatment of any

                  any way your ownership of any intellectual property rights in
                  your Content or the rights which you have to prevent your
                  Content from being copied without your permission. The waiver
                  is intended to allow us when dealing with your Content (as
                  permitted by the licence which you give us in section 10(b)
                  above) to add watermarks, stickers, or text to your Content.
